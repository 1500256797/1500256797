## About Me
Firstly, I'm a project manager who has successfully delivered over six projects with a cumulative value exceeding ten million. Secondly, I'm a passionate coder, proficient in programming languages like JavaScript, Rust, Move, and Solidity.

I also have experience in building distributed applications, utilizing tools such as Spring Cloud and Go Zero.

When it comes to front-end development frameworks, I'm highly skilled in React.

For desktop application development, I frequently use PyQt.

Furthermore, I possess experience in model training, including fine-tuning VITs models and working with Stable Diffusion's LORA model.
